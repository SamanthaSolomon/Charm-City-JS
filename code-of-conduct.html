            <h3>Anti-Harassment Policy</h3>
            <p>
                CharmCityJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup
                experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual
                orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
                or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup
                participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
                appropriate for any charmCityJS venue, including talks. Meetup
                participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled
                from charmCityJS at the discretion of the meetup organizers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
                sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
                race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
                intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
                recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
                inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
                Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected
                to comply immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup
                organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
                warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup. If you are
                being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
                have any other concerns, please contact a member of meetup
                organizers immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meetup organizers will be happy to help participants contact
                venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or
                otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for
                the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.

      <h3>Anti-Harassment Policy</h3>
      <p>
        CharmCityJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup
        experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
        disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
        tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language
        and imagery is not appropriate for any charmCityJS venue, including
        talks. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
        expelled from charmCityJS at the discretion of the meetup organizers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
        sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
        following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
        talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
        sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
        expected to comply immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers
        may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
        offender or expulsion from the meetup. If you are being harassed, notice
        that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
        contact a member of meetup organizers immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meetup organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue
        security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
        those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
        meetup. We value your attendance.
